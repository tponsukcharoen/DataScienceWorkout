    "## Data Science Job Interview: What's out there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviews can be phone screen (15 minutes to hour) or on-site (4 hours or more, usually split into 1 hour each). The topics and depths vary a lot from companies to companies. It can be generic or specific to the company. It can be technical or non-technical. Hence, the interview prep can be hard and exhausting. Plus, it is not just understanding the material. It is also about effectively communicating your knowledge and how you would contribute to the business goals. So keep practice interviews!\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful trick is to have a right mindset for the interview: It's not a test, you and interviewers are collaborators. Communicate and win together. In that way, you feel less stressed and act naturally. If you show your nature and the company does not like it, it's fine. It's like dating - you should not pretend to have a nice relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interview questions can be categorized into 3 groups: basic technical questions (CS, Prob&Stats, SQL, Machine Learning), business questions (mix of technical questions and business understanding), and cultural questions (non-technical).\n"

    "These question are textbook-style. It is quite straightforward but it can be difficult in two ways. First, any textbook-style questions can be hard when it moves to another level of understanding (applications, comparisons, relationship). Second, it can be frustrating when you do it on the screen or on the whiteboard while the interviewer is watching. It is tough but that's how you learn things and work as a data scientist in real life."

It is very subjective until you convince the interviewer that your way of thinking is sounding.  "
